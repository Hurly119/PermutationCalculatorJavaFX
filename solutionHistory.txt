This input (ARIM) has a length of: 4
We get the factorial of this number which is: 24.0
Since there are no repetitions,
this would be your number of permutations.


This input (TORR) has a length of: 4
We get the factorial of this number which is: 24.0
Since your input has repetitions,
 we have to get the factorial of the frequency of each characters.

Character T repeats 1 time(s).
the factorial is: 1.0
Character O repeats 1 time(s).
the factorial is: 1.0
Character R repeats 2 time(s).
the factorial is: 2.0

We then take the product
of the factorial of each character's frequency (2.0)
and divide it to the input length's factorial (24.0).
The permutation of your input is then: 12.0
